# SentimentRepresentation
we propose a model based on the bag of mixed-gram terms to deal with sentiment classification task and extracting sentimental features. We obtain a very short-dimensional vector to represent sentiment and use the sentimental representations to complete the task of sentiment classification. Furthermore, since the sentimental representa- tions and some traditional word vectors have complementary advantages, we combine the sentimental representations with convolutional neural networks that use other word vectors and ultimately implement a more efficient classifier. Experimental results show that this combination method can use static word vectors to deal with sentimental classification tasks well, and the sentimental representations here play the role of fine-turned word vectors in previous research.
